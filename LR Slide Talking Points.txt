Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical. For example, To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)

Its a statistical method to predict a discrete output or category within Machine Learning

Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1

In order to create less complex model we turned L1 and L2 Regularisation. Although it changed the confusion matrix, it wasn't a significant change

The key difference between these techniques is that L1 shrinks the less important featureâ€™s coefficient to zero thus, removing some feature altogether. This works well for feature selection in case we have a huge number of features.
